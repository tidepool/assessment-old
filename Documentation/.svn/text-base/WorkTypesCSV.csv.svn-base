HER,The Rushing River,The boss wants you to give a speech at the holiday party?  No worries.  Someone needs your help figuring out what’s wrong with the new copier?  Right in your wheelhouse.  A co-worker wants to have a long\, drawn-out discussion about general office morale and the social reasons behind it?  No thanks.  That's just not who you are.  You want to move.  You want to accomplish.  You want to take the lead\, rally the troops\, and get things done.  ,Your energy is a gift to use in your interactions at the workplace.  So is your ability to see the root of a problem and enthusiastically address it.  Your enjoyment of being with other people means that you're happy to work as a member of a team\, as long as that doesn't mean sitting around and thinking a problem to death.  ,Be careful that your knowledge and enthusiasm don’t cause you to ignore the good ideas of less outgoing colleagues.  And don’t short-change the thinking process.  Sometimes it may be important to think about and even – Yikes! – have a discussion before jumping into action.,The Rushing River brings charisma\, spontaneity\, and leadership through energetic action.,You are an effective leader,You enjoy taking action and working with others,Sometimes you should slow down and have a discussion before jumping into action
HEI,The Study Buddy,You love being with people.  A great conversation or a lunch with good friends leaves you feeling happy and even energized.  When it comes to work\, though\, you're less enthused about people-oriented activities.  You don't mind working with others\, but what you really like when you're given a task is analyzing the available information and then thinking it through from as many angles as possible.  If other people can help in this process\, great.  Otherwise\, though\, you'd just as soon work independently.,Your personality\, which combines an extravert's love of people with a scholar's love of analytical and intellectual exploration\, gives you the potential to be an extremely valuable team member at your work.  Not everyone who so enjoys logic and solving complex\, abstract problems\, also enjoys being with other people.

HEA,The Synergist,You're creative and independent\, but no one would ever accuse you of being an anti-social artist who hides in the studio.  You love being with other people\, and you draw much of your artistic energy from your interactions with others.  And even though you connect easily with people around you and feel excited by the thought of new relationships\, you remain committed to your own unique and original perspective on your work.  Your imagination and originality make you who you are\, and you have no problem taking an unconventional stance or coloring outside the lines., This strong combination of social comfort and artistic temperament allows you to smoothly glide into all kinds of diverse social and work environments.  Coworkers likely recognize you as someone who enjoys working as a team member\, but who also feels deeply and remains committed to your own perspective and vision.,A potential drawback to being a passionate person who enjoys interacting with others is that you face a greater potential to be disappointed\, and even hurt\, by people who may not share your enthusiasm and spirit.  After all\, when you put yourself out there\, emotionally and artistically\, you make yourself vulnerable.  So continue to follow your social and artistic instincts\, but remain aware that at times\, when you go against popular opinion\, there may be consequences.  And sometimes that will mean you've done just the right thing.,The Synergist contributes imagination\, originality and spirit along with a passionate and artistic perspective.,You have a unique artistic perspective,Your creativity and social prowess make you a valuable teammate,Sometimes you should speak out against popular opinion\, even if it means risking disappointed

Your ability to interact with and support others is a valuable talent that allows you to help people around you feel good about themselves.  ,Used wisely\, these people-oriented skills can help you achieve a great deal in a work environment.  The energy and enthusiasm you bring to working with others have the potential to make you a valued team member who’s able to pull people together and achieve success and accomplish difficult tasks.,Make sure that in your high-energy approach to work and interpersonal dealings\, you pay attention to the suggestions and ideas presented by those around you who present their opinions more quietly and subtly.

HEE,The Ringleader,When it comes to how you approach your work\, you bring to the table a powerful combination:  the desire to connect on a deep level with the people around you\, and also a  personality that likes organizing\, managing\, and leading others.  Add to all of this your enjoyment of working with people and your willingness to take risks\, and you have the potential to make great things happen.,The dangerous flip-side of this powerful coin is that in your pursuit of the next big thing\, you have the potential to lose sight of the personal concerns of the people around you\, or even of yourself.  Continue to follow your instincts\, and don't apologize for the big footprints you leave as you interact with and lead others; but as you stride deeper and deeper into each new\, exciting venture\, don't lose sight of the individual needs and concerns that surround you. ,Keep in mind\, too\, that someone has to follow through on the details.  Your focus may be on initiating and energizing a particular project\, and that’s great.

HEC,The Chaperone,"\"Measure twice\, cut once.\"  Rings pretty true for you\, doesn't it?  You want things done well and done right\, and rules and order are very important to you.  And even though it can frustrate you when others don't display the same attention to detail\, you really do enjoy being with the people around you.  You get excited by opportunities to work with others\, and after a meeting with a group or some time spent socializing\, you often find yourself energized and full of positive emotions.  ,This is a nice combination you bring to your work.  Many people who are as responsible as you are when it comes to carefully carrying out tasks\, aren't as interested in spending time with and working with other people.  Most likely\, you’re valued by your coworkers and managers because of these dual strengths.,One caution:  Be careful with your desire for order.  Consistency and reliability are very positive traits to bring to the workplace.  But don’t let them move you towards a rigidity that causes you to freak out when things get messy.  Part of being an effective worker is being able to follow instructions and routines when necessary\, but also flexibly deviate from them and adjust when situations call for it.,The Chaperone contributes routine\, order\, and deliberate leadership following a by-the-book mindset.,You value order and rules,You enjoy working with others,Sometimes you should remember to stay flexible and avoid becoming too reliant on traditional methods
LER,The Workhorse,You really love a job where you get to work independently and use your hands and some sort of tools.  Instead of working in a group\, you like going at a problem by yourself so you can control how everything turns out.  That way\, you can jump right into whatever task you’re presented with and figure it out by doing something.  You’re much less interested in sitting around thinking about how to address the situation.  ,Your practical-minded approach to your work can make you valuable to a team.  Any project needs someone who’s ready to jump in and get things done.  It may be\, too\, that you’re more quiet or low-key than some of your coworkers.  This type of personality can be a welcome addition to a work-group\, especially one where certain extraverts are already tending to dominate conversations and strategy sessions.,At times\, group activities can feel excruciating to someone less inclined to work with people or discuss and strategize about an issue.  Just keep reminding yourself that your independent\, can-do approach might be even more effective if you combined it with the forethought and insight of those you work with. ,The Workhorse brings independence\, action\, and autonomy along with an action-oriented approach.,You work best with independence and autonomy,,Sometimes you should speak up and strategize in group activities
LEI,The Bookworm,It's not that you dislike people on principle.  You just prefer to be on your own\, especially when it comes to your work.  You like to approach a task in a cool\, calm\, deliberate manner\, and this low-key approach allows you to find comfort and happiness at work.  When you’re given a problem to solve\, you observe any and all important information\, analyze the data\, then offer a clear\, reasoned response based on what you’ve seen.  Working independently often gives you a better chance of achieving this kind of deliberate\, studied approach to a situation.,The serious\, analytical way you approach your work most likely earns you respect from your managers and coworkers.  Someone who can organize and understand information\, then come up with unique and unconventional ways of dealing with a problem\, is a valuable asset to any team.,Keep in mind\, though\, that for a team to succeed\, its many different parts need to work together successfully.  Even though your preference is to work independently and to use your mind to solve problems that arise\, don’t forget that you'll often be depending on others to apply your ideas and put them into action.  So when you are required to work with others\, remind yourself that you are helping each other get things done as effectively as possible.  Then\, afterwards\, you can make sure you find time to \"re-charge\" with some time alone.  ,The Bookworm brings analytical reasoning and deliberate action along with an effective lone-wolf mindset.,You are independent and analytical,You can dissect problems and devise unconventional solutions,Since you will be forced to work with others at times\, make sure to rmaintain communication with your team
LEA,The Ghostwriter,Some people need to be with others all the time.  It feeds them\, gives them energy.  But not you.  Too much time with other people wears you out and leaves you feeling depleted.  It’s not that you don’t like other people; it’s just that you need time by yourself to think\, and to feel.  You love to use your creativity and imagination\, and when you get enough free time\, you’re at your best.  Then you can follow your creative instincts and solve problems by coming up with inventive and unique solutions.,You’re especially drawn to unconventional ideas.  For you\, rules and routine may prove helpful at times\, but just as often they may end up hindering the problem-solving process.  You want to be left alone to chase out imaginative insights and tackle obstacles by creating something new.,Don't forget\, though\, that sometimes a team or a partnership can address problems in creative and interesting ways as well.  Stay true to your inclination to work independently\, but remain open to the possibility that synergy with others might open up new and powerful possibilities as well.,The Ghostwriter brings imagination\, creativity\, and independence through intensive self-guidance.,You value creativity and independence,You excel at devising and implementing original solutions to unconventional problems,Sometimes you should work with others to broaden your horizons
LES,The Loyalist,You care about people.  You want to help them\, and teach them\, and you enjoy the relationships you develop in your work.  However\, it’s not at all that you’re an extravert.  In fact\, being around people too much can completely wear you out.  After you’ve spent several hours solving problems and helping people at work\, you may be left feeling completely depleted\, like a car that's run out of gas.,This is a unique combination of skills you bring to your job.  Not all introverts feel such a connection to other people\, or experience the empathy and sensitivity to social cues that you do.  Most likely\, your low-key approach to your interactions with others is part of what allows you to be so successful when it comes to addressing obstacles and solving problems.,Just make sure that in your efforts to help others and to give of yourself\, you take time to re-fill your own tank by finding time to be alone.

LEE,The Chess Master,You have good communication skills and like to use them to lead others.  You can organize a team to take on a challenge\, and inspire them to get on board and follow your vision.  These are powerful gifts to bring to a work place.  What makes you especially interesting\, is the fact that you're not really an extravert. In fact\, being with people can completely exhaust you.  Despite your ability to organize\, persuade\, and manage others\, you desire -- and even need -- time alone.,When you get that time to re-charge\, you can come across as confident and assertive\, even energetic.  Some people may see you as a risk-taker who's able to see the big idea and move people toward it.  While others may end up being responsible for carrying out your original vision\, it's you who provides the inspiration and influence to get it off the ground.,Obviously\, it's important that you continue to take care of yourself by finding time to be alone and re-fill your tank.  Also\, make sure that you pay attention to the needs and desires of the people around you.

LEC,True Blue,Nobody's going to catch you wearing a lampshade on your head at the company holiday party.  Being showy\, or pushing the envelope in some way\, just isn't your style.  You prefer structure and order in your life\, and in your work.  You are deliberate and low-key when you approach a task\, and you're especially good at following rules and routines.  You can work with others when you need to\, but your preference is to work independently and get things done\, assuring that every detail is taken care of.,As a result\, you're able to provide crucial services to the running of a team.  While others focus on big ideas and overall visions\, your orderly and practical approach to a project allows you to focus on the specifics and make sure everything gets done.  ,Remain aware of your preference for working independently\, and your need to find \"alone time\" so you can re-charge yourself after being with others.

HOR,The Jack of All Trades, Some people get nervous when presented with novel and complex ideas.  They prefer things to be familiar and conventional.  You\, on the other hand\, welcome the new.  You're not necessarily excited by the thought of sitting down with your coworkers and having a long\, drawn-out discussion about how to solve a particular problem; your preference is usually to get busy and do something\, rather than talking about doing something.  But it's not like you mind being shown a new and interesting way to approach an issue.  In fact\, you welcome it.,This is a unique and valuable combination you bring to your work.  It's somewhat rare to find someone as open-minded as you are be so eager to jump straight into a job.  Your intellectual curiosity and comfort with complexity provide a nice balance to your \"let's get 'er done\" approach to your job.,Work to maintain this balance\, without giving in to either side exclusively.  Jumping into a task without considering alternatives and consequences can lead to bad decisions and all kinds of trouble.  But you also don't want to be so open-minded that you have trouble ever making a decision.  You have the ability to pay attention to both of these aspects of yourself.  As long as you continue to strike that balance\, you'll continue to play a valuable role in your workplace.,The Jack of All Trades invents and implements original solutions to complex problems through immediate action.,You are excited by novel and complex ideas,You prefer diving into a problem rather than sitting around and talking about it,Sometimes you should sit back and brainstorm before tackling a project
HOI,The Connoisseur,That old cliché about curiosity killing the cat just doesn't ring true to you.  In fact\, you thrive on curiosity and coming up with novel ways to address problems.  New ideas excite you\, and you welcome a challenge that asks you to research a problem\, analyze the data\, and come up with an interesting and novel response.  You're an independent thinker with strong skills when it comes to organizing and understanding information.,As such\, you can be a very valuable employee and coworker.  Your openness to new ideas\, combined with your analytical skills\, mean that you're often able to find whole new ways to address a problem that arises.  ,You're less interested in working in groups or with other people.  And while it's great to be a strong\, independent thinker\, this is one area of growth you might want to explore.  Take that openness and curiosity that are such strong aspects of your personality\, and let them lead you towards working more effectively with the people around you.  Who knows what novel and interesting results may appear?,The Connoisseur analyzes and solves complex problems with a combination of curiosity\, organization\, and inventiveness.,You are excited by new ideas and intriguing challenges,You have strong organizational and analytical skills,Sometimes you should work in groups\, since your skillset makes you an asset to any team
HOA,The Different Drummer,Some people are willing to think outside the box.  You?  You want to blow that mother up.  You take open-mindedness to a whole new level\, absolutely embracing new experiences.  More than most people\, you're intellectually curious and appreciative of the beauty around you. This applies to your general personality\, as well as the way you approach your work.  When faced with a new task\, you address it with creativity and imagination\, looking for interesting ways to tackle the problem.,When it comes to conventional thinking and following traditions and customs\, you're just not interested.  You greatly prefer to chart new territory\, see in new ways\, and use your hands and your mind to create new things.  As a result\, you're most likely highly prized as a thinker\, as someone who's able to come up with inventive and insightful responses to new issues as they arrive.,Even though you thrive in unconventional\, unstructured settings\, keep in mind that not everyone does.  Your coworkers\, and even your manager\, may approach their work much differently from how you do.  So continue to bring your enthusiasm and imagination to your job\, but watch for ways\, as well\, to appreciate other approaches\, and to integrate them into your own way of doing things.,The Different Drummer spearheads alternative paths to success using sheer creativity and imagination.,You excel at applying artistic creativity and imagination to complex problems,You are always open to tackling projects with new strategies and approaches,Sometimes you should seek the input of your more routine-oriented peers so that you can see all sides of a problem
HOS,The Clicker,Whatever comes your way\, you're ready for it.  You invite new experiences into your life\, and you're willing to examine alternatives to how things have always been done.  This especially applies to situations where you can help someone else.  You care about the people around you\, and you understand that sometimes it's necessary to \"think outside the box\" when it comes to pulling people together to generate positive energy for a good cause.,Most likely\, the people you work with appreciate your intellectual curiosity\, and the way it allows you to accomplish lots of different tasks and interact with a diverse group of people.  All of this\, combined with your communication skills\, makes you a valuable member of a team.,One word of caution:  Don't let your people-centered open-mindedness earn you a reputation for being impractical.  Keep in mind that there are times\, especially in a work situation\, when what's needed is a quick\, concrete decision.  In  moments like that\, you should still remain open to alternative perspectives\, but be flexible enough to respond to scheduling constraints and other realities that face you and your team.,The Clicker uses experimental techniques\, curiosity\, and an inventive sense of sociability to bring teams together.,You get along well with others,You excel at inventing alternative solutions to complex problems,Sometimes you should prioritize deadlines over open-ended inventiveness
HOE,The Maverick,Sure\, caution has its place.  Just not in the life of someone who wants to accomplish much and ultimately take steps toward making big things happen.  And that's you.  You bring great energy and leadership to your work\, and you're perfectly willing to take risks to achieve the goals set for yourself and your team.  When new possibilities present themselves\, you're ready to jump in and see where new roads might take you.,The same goes for different ways of looking at old problems.  You come at your life and work with an attitude of intellectual curiosity\, ready to explore alternative approaches and consider imaginative responses.  Plus\, because of your communication skills and sociable personality\, you're often able to inspire others to follow your lead in this area.,This ability to envision new approaches from an open and flexible perspective is a significant strength.  But don't forget the importance of follow-through as well.  Whether it's you or one of your team-members\, assign someone to be responsible for making sure that good ideas don't wither and die on the vine.  Once you've come up with new and interesting approaches to address problems that arise\, do your best to follow through and make your vision a reality.,The Maverick brings energy\, leadership\, and imaginative approaches through enthusiastic action.,You embrace risk and new possibilities,You get along well with others,Sometimes you should slow down and focus exclusively on completing your projects
HOC,The Metronome,You are curious and imaginative\, and you fully understand the importance of considering diverse perspectives when making decisions.  You're open to new experiences\, and you don't mind thinking \"outside the box.\"  That being said\, when it comes to your work\, you like order and structure.  In other words\, your open-mindedness doesn't mean that you're willing to put up with chaos and a lack of clarity when it's time to get something done.,Instead\, you like rules and details\, and you're good at following directions.  Even though you welcome new ideas and experiences\, routines and order make you feel secure and certain.  This combination gives you the potential to be a highly valuable team-member at your job\, since you offer both openness to new ideas as well as the follow-through to get things done.,Watch for ways to capitalize on this unique combination.  The next time a problem arises at work\, use your affinity for rules and routine to come up with a new and interesting step-by-step approach to solving it.  Consider new alternatives and use your creativity to come up with a clear and orderly way to address the issue.  The more you can integrate your open attitude with your appreciation for organization\, the more effective you'll be at solving problems and getting things done.,The Metronome has the imagination and drive to implement time-tested solutions to unconventional problems.,You have the curiosity and imagination to solve complex problems,You rely on order and structured routine to complete projects,Sometimes you should slow down and make sure that your routines have the flexibility to work around unexpected issues
LOR,The Bullet Train,You know what you believe\, and you want to remain consistent to what you know to be true.  That applies to interacting with others as well as getting a job done.  You're just not that interested in going too far outside of what you've already determined works. Other people may want to chase down every new idea that pops up before them\, but not you.  You prefer to rely on what's been proven and time-tested.  ,As a result\, when you're presented with a task at work\, you like to jump in and get it done\, without wasting a lot of time discussing it and theorizing about how best to do it.  You're especially happy if you get to use your hands and work with objects and tools.,One of the best things about your approach to life and work is your consistency:  people know who you are\, and what to expect from you.  A potential drawback\, though\, is that you may be missing out on new opportunities to learn even better ways to accomplish your tasks.  We're not saying you shouldn't be as practical and reliable as you are; just that the chances are that by being just a bit more flexible and open-minded\, you might be able to accomplish even more and be even more effective than you already are.,The Bullet Train relies on experience\, persistence\, and proven methods to tackle problems directly and immediately.,You tackle projects using trusted routines and traditional solutions,You prefer jumping into an assignment rather than having endless conversations about it,Sometimes you should remain flexible and keep alternative approaches in mind
LOI,The Curious Critic,You bring a certain amount of complexity to your work.  On one hand\, you're very steadfast in your beliefs.  You know what you've learned to be true\, and you're not too interested in spending time chasing after every new idea or perspective that pops up.  On the other hand\, though\,  you enjoy collecting information and analyzing situations.  You're naturally curious\, even though you prefer to rely on the tried and true.,Now might be a good time to think through this apparent dichotomy in your work preferences.  For example\, what is it that keeps you from being more inclined to consider alternative opinions or to look at new ways of getting a job done?  And how does that jibe with your natural enjoyment of analytical and intellectual pursuits?  Do you feel any internal conflict as a result of these differing desires?,The better you can understand this apparent paradox within yourself\, the more effective you can be at your work\, and most likely\, in your relationships.  You have significant gifts and abilities\, so do your best to figure out how best to integrate them and use them in concert with each other.,The Curious Critic examines problems with an analytical curiosity before solving them with proven methods.,You enjoy analyzing complex problems,You rely on trusted routines and traditional strategies to get assignments done,Sometimes you should force yourself out of your routine and try out a promising new method or strategy
LOA,The Window Shopper,You bring an artistic sensibility to your work.  You appreciate beauty\, and you enjoy interesting and unusual people and objects.  What makes all of this particularly interesting is that for the most part\, you seem to prefer what's familiar over what's novel.  In other words\, rather than exploring a new or alternative idea or approach to a situation\, you're more likely to rely on what you've already found to be true.,There's nothing wrong with this \"tried and true\" approach to your work.  But it's unusual that you'd so be so steadfast in your commitment to your own ideals and opinions\, and still feel so inclined towards art and creativity.   ,Do you see ways that your creative and imaginative approach to your work might be enhanced by a bit more openness when it comes to new ideas and unconventional approaches to a given problem?  We're not saying you need to change your down-to-earth way of doing things; just that you might discover that you can be even more true to who you are if you let yourself color outside the lines from time to time.,The Window Shopper always examines new approaches to problems\, but usually sticks with the reliable and proven methods.,You combine creativity and imagination with trusted routines,You prefer familiar strategies over unproven approaches,Sometimes you should use your creativity to invent new solutions
LOS,The Big Fish,You know who you are\, and you know what you believe.  You value the consistency in your own beliefs\, and when you're presented with new ideas\, you'll generally explore them only if they jibe pretty well with what you've already determined to be true.  ,For example\, think about your devotion to helping the people around you.  In your mind\, this is simply an important part of who you are\, and you have a good sense of how best to go about doing that.  You have good relational skills\, and you like to use them to work with people and help solve their problems.  You can be very empathetic and sensitive to emotional cues\, which allows you to pull people together when you need to and inspire others to join together to accomplish a task. This is an admirable trait\, and it makes sense that you'd remain committed to doing things as you have in the past.,However\, one drawback to your consistency is that you're not always very comfortable exploring and accepting novel ideas and new ways of doing things.  As a result\, you sometimes limit yourself in terms of what you can see and accomplish.  It's also at least possible that you might miss out on a chance to use your considerable relational skills to help someone else\, if you've written them off because of some perceived difference between the two of you.  So keep sticking to your principles and beliefs; but watch for ways to broaden your perspective and try new approaches\, so you can be even more effective when it comes to what you can accomplish\, and who you can help.,The Big Fish tackles and unravels problems with a combination of consistency\, routine\, and sociability.,You get along well with others,You rely on intuition and stick with trusted routines to reach success,Sometimes you should broaden your perspective and experiment with a new approach
LOE,The Standout,Decisive.  Consistent. Persuasive.  These are words you might use to describe yourself.  You have good communication skills\, and you use them to influence\, persuade\, and lead others.  This strength can make you extremely valuable when it comes to getting things done in a work environment--especially because you're willing to make tough decisions and take some risks in order to make things happen.,One part of your personality that further strengthens your ability to get things done is your confidence in yourself\, and in what you believe.  You have faith in yourself and\, more than most people\, you're suspicious of alternative ideas and ways of doing things.  As you make the quick\, assertive decisions that come so naturally to you\, you prefer to do so based on the tried-and-true\, instead of the supposedly new-and-improved.,While this confidence in your own perspective can be a real strength\, though\, it can also be a liability.  If you close yourself off to novel ideas or unconventional ways of getting a job done\, you miss out on the potential for an even bigger payday if your risks and hard work eventually pay off.  So continue to follow your own instincts\, and let your skills lead you towards more and more success.  But keep in mind that there's more than one way to skin a cat\, and if someone shows you something new\, they just might be offering you a ticket to exciting and rewarding possibilities you've never even considered.,The Standout brings confidence\, persuasiveness\, and leadership through dependibility.,You excel at leadership and persuasion,You get along well with others,Sometimes you should experiment with new approaches to problems
LOC,The Rock,Flighty.  Erratic.  Impulsive.  These are words that have never been used to describe you and your approach to work.  Instead\, you're more likely to be described as analytical\, consistent\, and steadfast.  Novelty -- in ideas or approaches to certain situations at work -- doesn't really appeal too much to you.  You prefer to rely on information that you've already found to be familiar and logical.,This down-to-earth approach to life definitely describes the way you go about your job.  Rules and routines appeal to you.  It just makes sense that you'd follow directions\, rather than randomly going off in a new\, uncharted direction that might be full of all kinds of pitfalls and negative consequences.  You understand the importance of the details\, of order\, and you do your best to live and work in a way that prioritizes practicality and the tried and true.,One of the main strengths to your approach to life and work is your consistency and reliability.  People know what to expect from you.  A big drawback\, however\, is that you may be closing yourself off from growth and learning.  What are the chances\, would you say\, that you could remain the same reliable\, consistent you\, but also watch for opportunities to be just a bit more welcoming of new and alternative ways to approach a situation or conquer an obstacle?  If you can add just a touch of flexibility to your already strong reliability\, you will become even more effective and valuable to the people you work with.,The Rock relies on an analytical mindset\, persistence and traditional strategies to get any job done. ,You use trusted routines and consistency to complete assignments,You can focus on the smaller details of a project to ensure that everything will run smoothly,Sometimes you should try out new approaches and strategies\, even if doing so goes against your nature
HAR,The Go Getter,Give you a job to do and you'll do it.  Especially if it involves working with your hands or fixing something by jumping straight into the problem.  If other people want to help out\, fine by you.  You enjoy working with others\, and you have no problem  collaborating to accomplish a task.  You even like it.  Especially if your coworkers are ready to go straight to work with you\, as opposed to talking a problem to death.,Those are some pretty attractive attributes when it comes to how you'll be seen in your workplace.  A can-do kind of person who knows how to tackle a job\, and who also knows how to get along with coworkers\, is a valuable person to have around.  ,One issue to think about:  How comfortable are you if someone at your job wants to take some time to think a problem through\, or even -- god forbid -- discuss it for a while.  If this is the kind of thing that makes you cringe\, then you might want to give it some thought.  After all\, your \"jump in and solve any problem\" approach might be even more effective and valuable if you combined it with just a bit more planning and discussion of the issue at hand.,The Go Getter brings sociability\, collaboration\, and a pursuit of results together for immediate action.,You prefer jumping into problems rather than endlessly discussing them,You get along well with others,Sometimes you should plan ahead before leaping into action
HAI,The Super Sleuth,You have a pretty unique skill-set in that you can\, on one hand\, cooperate with others and create social harmony in a group setting.  On the other hand\, you typically take an analytical approach to your work\, preferring to do your job independently so you can chase down whatever interesting and curious leads appear.  ,It might even be that you could more fully use your ability to get along with others when it comes to how you accomplish certain tasks.  For example\, the individual research and analysis you so enjoy and prize might become even more effective and valuable if you were to bounce some of your findings and ideas off of one or more of your coworkers.  Even though you're careful and methodical when you approach a task\, it might be that by working with someone else\, you'd be able to come up with a solution to a problem that's even more unique or insightful than the one you'd come to on your own.,Watch for ways to combine these different parts of yourself.  The more you can integrate the people-loving aspect of your personality with the curious and independent analytical part of yourself\, the more you'll be able to see things from whole new perspectives\, and accomplish even more along the way. ,The Super Sleuth provides independent and analytical research skills that  establish a foundation for a team's success.,You excel at cooperation and transforming groups into teams,You enjoy the freedom and independence that come with a lone-wolf approach,Sometimes you should integrate your independent mindset and people skills to see problems from a variety of perspectives
HAA,The Free Spirit,Getting along with other people is something you typically do really well.  You approach life from an enthusiastic and generous perspective.  Because of your creative and artistic personality\, combined with your agreeable nature\, you bring a unique and valuable skill set to any work environment.  Whereas some people with your creative temperament might have trouble working with others\, you thrive when it comes to cooperation and social harmony.,There are\, though\, a couple of potential pitfalls you want to remain aware of.  For one\, your artistic personality may leave you less comfortable with structure\, and with following rules that keep a workplace running and effective.  Also\, your desire to maintain good social relationships could potentially make it harder for you to make difficult or unpopular decisions when they're required.  ,As long as you remain aware of these possible tendencies\, you'll most likely remain a valued member of any team at work\, appreciated by the people you work with.,The Free Spirit brings enthusiasm\, creativity\, and sociability through an artistic perspective.,You excite teams with your knacks for enthusiasm and generosity,You get along well with others,Sometimes you should make difficult decisions\, even if doing so interferes with the social harmony of your team
HAS,The Host,"\"Plays well with others.\"  There's probably a good chance that your kindergarten teacher wrote something like that on your first report card.  Not only do you enjoy being with other people\, you actually trust those around you for the most part.  You've been rewarded through the years for this optimistic outlook on human nature\, in that you've developed strong relationships and helped a lot of people along the way.  Your coworkers likely view you as a good team member and appreciate your ability to use feelings\, words\, and ideas to get things done.,Continue to use this strength in your dealings with the people you live and work with.  But keep in mind that at times\, you may need to make decisions that aren't popular.  There's nothing inherently wrong with being a people pleaser.  Just make sure that your desire for strong and healthy relationships doesn't keep you from making tough or objective decisions.  You'll gain even more respect from your boss and coworkers if you can combine your people skills with a strong\, independent mind.,Make sure\, too\, that before you compromise your own needs and desires\, you've considered whether this is a healthy choice that will lead you to be happier and more effective at your job. ,The Host can easily form friendly relationships and unite teams with an attitude of optimism and trust.,You get along well with others,You can form strong relationships and transform groups into teams,Sometimes you should make difficult decisions\, even if doing so interferes with the social harmony of your team
HAE,The Trailblazer,You show signs of having great strength when it comes to working with other people.  You know how to cooperate and work with a team\, and you like leading others.  This is a powerful combination\, because your ability to work with the people around you can give you a better chance at getting some of your big ideas off the ground.,After all\, you do like the big idea.  You can see opportunities that others miss\, and you enjoy using your way with words to persuade others to get on board.  You have a basically optimistic outlook on human nature\, and this is one thing that leads you to believe that you can solve big problems and accomplish great things.,Watch out\, though\, that your desire to cooperate and to have people follow you\, doesn't keep you from making decisions that others won't like.  As you've probably already seen\, in order leading effectively often requires that you remain objective and make the tough calls\, even when they're unpopular.,The Trialblazer brings optimism\, leadership\, and cooperation together with a big-picture perspective.,You are a natural leader,You can effortlessly cooperate and work with a team,Sometimes you should make difficult decisions\, even if doing so interferes with the social harmony of your team
HAC,The Advocate,Some people have a hard time getting along with others.  Not you.  The people you work with find you considerate and friendly\, and they know that when you're asked to complete a task\, not only are you not going to rock the boat\, you're going to complete the job well and on time.  This makes you a valued coworker.  ,Leading others isn't really your thing\, since your preference is to follow directions\, rather than give them.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  Your attention to detail and ability to keep others organized is crucial for running an efficient workplace.  Add to this your talent for getting along with others\, and it's no wonder that people at work see you as someone with much to offer., At some point someone may ask you to make an unpopular decision or to go against an established routine. Stay true to who you are\, but watch for times when it might be advantageous to step outside of your comfort zone.  ,The  Advocate brings reliability\, cooperation\, and teamwork to the table and can help any team reach success.,You complete tasks well and ahead of time,You get along well with others,Sometimes you should make difficult decisions\, even if doing so interferes with the social harmony of your team
LAR,The Lone Ranger,When someone gives you a task\, something like this might go through your mind:  \"Just get out of my way\, and I'll get it done.  Don't make me work with a group\, and for god's sake don't make me discuss it to death.\"  You enjoy hard work\, especially if you get to use your hands.  Even better if you get to be outdoors.  And people know they can count on you to jump right in when an obstacle arises.,One thing you don't enjoy so much is having to interact with others while you're doing your job.  It just doesn't make sense.  You can see the problem\, and you'll be able to address it and complete the job\, so there's no reason to bring in someone else who might just muck things up and make the whole task harder than it needs to be.,Your tough-minded independence is a strength\, especially in a world where it's increasingly rare.  However\, as you probably already know\, interacting with others is a necessary part of most jobs.  So try to stay open-minded to ways other people might be able to help you do your job even better.  A long\, drawn-out discussion may not be necessary\, but with a bit more careful analysis\, it might be that you can do your job even more effectively\, not to mention learn something along the way.  ,The Lone Ranger provides hard work\, reliability\, and perseverance through independence.,You prefer diving into action rather than endlessly discussing assignments,You value independence and autonomy,Sometimes you should slow down and plan your approach for a little while before jumping into action
LAI,The Scientist,Cooperate?  Collaborate?  Interact?  Sheesh.  It's exhausting having to work with other people all the time.  You prefer to work independently\, using your own wits to address a problem.  You want to see the issue\,  analyze and understand the information\, then come up with a logical and maybe even insightful solution. ,It's not that you think others couldn't possibly be helpful to you during this process.  It's just that if you want something done right\, well\, then you don't want a bunch of other people mucking up the procedure.  ,One thing you might want to consider\, from a logical\, analytical perspective:  Isn't it at least possible that sometimes\, your analysis might be improved if another good mind were working with you?  Isn't there a chance that you might discover an even more interesting and insightful response to whatever issue you're addressing?   We're not saying not to stay true to who you are; just that you might want to stay open to the possibility that adding the insight of another perspective might allow you to be effective than you already are.,The Scientist brings logic\, analytical intuition\, and independence through thoughtful action.,You like tackling complex problems with independence and creative autonomy,You use logic and strong analytical skills to solve problems,Sometimes you should try collaborating with a trusted teammate\, since on certain tasks two minds are more effective than one
LAA,The Soloist,When you're taking on a particular task\, you have a vision for how it should be done.  You're not interested in rules conventions\, and your sure don't want others coming around trying to influence how the work should go.  You want to use your own creativity\, and your own imagination\, to handle the issue the way it should be handled.,That's one reason you cringe at the thought of collaboration.  The way you see it\, independent thought and expression are going to take you a lot further than having to participate in some sort of group-think.  You don't mean to be unfriendly about it\, it's just that an unstructured\, unencumbered atmosphere where you get to work alone gives you the best chance of coming up with a creative and insightful response to whatever the task is.,Your commitment to independent thought is admirable.  But realize\, too\, that genius rarely occurs in a vacuum.  Aristotle had Plato\, Rogers had Hammerstein\,  Kermit had Miss Piggy.  All of these individuals took their own\, individual sparks\, and joined them with the ideas and insights of another\, and created something even more valuable as a result.  The point isn't to change who you are.  Your independent thought is powerful\, so continue to rely on it.  But stay open to the possibility that even greater insights might be possible if you join your vision with that of another.,The Soloist brings independence\, vision\, and imagination through a fiery sense of artistic passion.,You value creativity autonomy and independence in problem-solving,You find that when teammates try to help\, they oftentimes just get in your way,Sometimes you should make sure to stay open to the input of your peers
LAS,The Paradox,Even though you often choose to work with people and to collaborate on projects\, you usually feel fairly uncomfortable when you're asked to get along with and rely on others.  It's not that you're a loner\, it's just that you're not sure you trust people to be consistently honest and decent.,This can make the workplace a difficult environment for you sometimes\, in that you experience the fact that your different feelings and desires are pulling you in opposite directions.  On one hand you care about and enjoy the people around you; but on the other hand\, working too closely them can make you feel a bit crunchy inside.  ,These feelings about the people in your life are probably worth exploring in some way.  The more you can get a handle on the different desires that are in conflict with each other\, the more you'll be able to achieve what you want to achieve in your work and relationships.,The Paradox has an eye for detail and navigates through team projects using an innate sense of apprehensive sociability.,You excel at collaboration and teamwork,You feel uncomfortable relying on others to complete projects,Sometimes you should take a step back and try to resolve your conflicting social impulses
LAE,The Podium Leader,You have legitimate skill when it comes to leading and persuading others.  You're a good talker\, and as a result you can organize a team and inspire them to get things done.  You love the big idea\, and you don't mind taking risks when great rewards are possible.,Interestingly\, though\, you don't always enjoy working with the people around you.  It's not that you're a loner.  On the contrary\, it's when you're working with others and leading them towards a goal that you feel most satisfied.  But still\, you're not exactly vibing on the collaborative and cooperative aspect of your job.  People\, for you\, are more of a necessary evil you have to put up with\, rather than a valuable resource from which to draw strength or inspiration.,We don't suggest that you  change who you are when it comes to interacting with others.  But like it or not\, the big idea rarely comes into existence because of just one person.  Chances are you're going to need other people\, so you'll do yourself a favor if you accept that fact and work on getting along with the people you work with.,The Podium Leader brings organization\, inspiration\, and leadership through a knack for persuasive sociability.,You excel at leadership\, organization\, and persuasion,You can use your vision to inspire teammates,Sometimes you should rely on your teammates rather than stressing yourself out with excessive work
LAC,The Creature of Habit,One phrase that rings true for you is\, \"A place for everything and everything in its place.\"  In fact\, your love of order and structure is probably one reason other people can get on your nerves.  Coworkers can have a tendency to erode structure and make things less clear and orderly.,What you want at your job is to be given a task and allowed to do it.  You're good at following directions\, and your attention to detail makes you valuable to any group or employer who needs someone good at organization.  ,Don't forget\, though\, that for most jobs\, working with people is more than a necessary evil.  It's the way things are done.  And more than that\, it also often gives you a chance to accomplish more than you can by yourself.  One way you can make it more enjoyable to work with others is to communicate clearly with your coworkers about what you like and don't like.  The better you all understand one another\, the more you'll enjoy working together\, and the more you'll be able to accomplish as a team.,The Creature of Habit brings independence\, an eye for detail\, and organization through a structured mindset.,You value structured routines and independence,You can focus on the small details of a project and make sure everything runs smoothly,Sometimes you should rely on your teammates rather than stressing yourself out with excessive work
HCR,The Laser Beam,Maybe it's true that there are no stupid questions.  But as far as you can tell\, there sure are a lot of inquisitive idiots running around asking about things that are pretty simple.  Your advice to them?  Just do things the right way\, the way they should be done.  You're less interested in discussing a problem to death\, and more interested in jumping right in and tackling it head-on. As a result\, you typically accomplish a great deal\, and others know they can count on you to complete a project well and in a timely fashion--especially if that project requires mechanical and physical skill.  ,Keep in mind\, though\, that there's more than one way to skin a cat.  Others may be less methodical than you when it comes to addressing an obstacle\, but their spontaneity may offer certain advantages that provide a nice counter-balance to your steady approach.  The same goes for people who want to study and discuss an issue before springing to action; that kind of approach might make your action-oriented tactics even more effective.  So stay true to who you are\, but remain open to new ways of addressing certain problems.,,The Laser Beam brings accomplishment\, perseverance\, and reliability through an action-oriented mindset.,You prefer jumping into action over endlessly discussing assignments.,You always complete projects well and on-time,Sometimes you should plan out your approach before diving into a project
HCI,The Algorithmist,Give you a puzzle\, and you'll solve it.  Offer you a riddle\, and you'll figure it out.  If you can't come up with an answer by your own analysis\, you'll lose sleep and skip meals researching until the issue is solved.  And you do things the right way.  Others may act impulsively or seize the first option that presents itself\, but snap decisions aren't really your thing.  You prefer planning and persistence\, knowing they'll pay off.,No doubt you've seen a ton of success with this approach to whatever obstacle pops up before you.  But keep in mind that lots of other approaches can produce success as well.  For example\, faced with a time constraint\, you may need to act more swiftly than you're usually comfortable with.  Or there may come a time when the apparently logical approach needs to be massaged because of the way it'll affect the people involved.  So stick to your methodical approach that's been so successful\, but stay open-minded that there may be other ways to tackle a problem.,,The Algorithmist delivers timely results through a rigorous routine of planning and perseverance.,You always analyze and plan before leaping into action.,You always complete projects well and on-time,Sometimes you should reassess your plans to make sure there's room for flexibility
HCA,The Stickler,Integrity is a hallmark of who you are.   You care about using your creativity and imagination to produce something new and worthwhile.  Others might be willing to simply settle for a short-term fix to a problem\, or to impulsively offer what appears to be a solution.  But for you\, what matters is seeing the issue before you\, then planning out an inventive\, original response that'll accomplish what needs to be done.,This approach to life and work is admirable in about a million ways.  But keep in mind that perfectionism can also end up being counter-productive; it can even lead to paralysis.  There may be times--because of a time constraint or some other reality--that you'll need to settle for the very good\, instead of achieving the great.  Stay true to your principles\, and to who you are; after all\, your planning and persistence are keys to the success you've seen in your work.  But keep an open mind that there may be other ways to achieve a desired end\, and there may be times when you need to be more spontaneous or even impulsive.,,The Stickler brings creativity and inventive imagination through a passionate sense of artistic integrity.,You excel at implementing original solutions to complex problems.,You use your creativity and vision to find effective alternative approaches to deal with problems,Sometimes you should abandon your perfectionism in order to deliver timely results
HCS,The Choreographer,The way you see it\, if you're going to do a job\, you might as well do it right.  The first time.  And unlike many others who share your conscientiousness\, you can typically find a way to achieve a high level of quality and still maintain a commitment to treating people the right way.  In fact\, one of your primary strengths when it comes to accomplishing the tasks that pop up before you\, is your ability to pull people together and unite them for a common cause.,This combination of conscientiousness and social skills allows you to succeed in ways other simply can't.  But remember\, too\, that other approaches to a problem may produce success as well.  And be wary of your tendency towards perfectionism.  Even though you like to plan and formulate a strategy before tackling a particular obstacle\, keep in mind that there may be moments -- because of time constraints or some other impending reality -- that a quicker\, snap decision is required.  ,,The Choreographer brings foresight\, leadership\, and organized planning through structured sociability.,You get along well with others.,You excel at uniting teams and delivering results,Sometimes you should abandon your perfectionism in order to deliver timely results
HCE,The Entrepreneur,For you\, God's not only in the details\, but in the big idea as well.  That's a pretty powerful combination.  Not only are you able to see the big picture and inspire others to believe in it\, you also have the ability to purposefully plan and carry out a strategy for making it a reality.,The energy and enthusiasm you bring to a project is one reason people will follow you.  Another is the respect you earn when you roll up your sleeves and methodically go to work on getting things done--the right way.  Be patient with the people around you who approach tasks differently\, and remain open to new ways to tackle an issue.  Sometimes a less meticulous strategy can result in new and surprising solutions to a problem.,,The Entrepreneur brings energy\, enthusiasm\, and a focused attention to detail through a big-picture perspective.,You have a big-picture perspective.,You can break down and plan out assignments in order to achieve fantastic results,Sometimes you should consider new approaches to projects rather than sticking to your favorite routines out of habit
HCC,The Detailer,As far as you're concerned\, \"Throw caution to the wind\" is a phrase used by irresponsible adrenaline addicts who accomplish little and suffer all kinds of undesirable\, long-term consequences.  Your approach to life and work is measured and sensible.  By doing things the right way\, crossing every \"t\" and dotting every \"i\,\" you can feel comfortable knowing that your planning and persistence will pay off. ,One temptation for you to resist is to immediately dismiss any new idea or approach offered by someone who arrives at solutions differently from you.  Your commitment to completing an assignment as it's been presented is admirable.  Just don't let your desire to follow directions or observe a set routine cause you to miss out on learning something new\, or seeing a novel way to address an issue.  In other words\, stay true to who you are\, but work hard to remain open-minded as well.,,The Detailer uses persistence\, planning\, and proven strategies to achieve perfect results on the first attempt.,You always analyze and plan before leaping into action.,You rely on trusted routines and traditional strategies in order to achieve ideal results,Sometimes you should consider new approaches to projects rather than sticking to your favorite routines out of habit
LCR,The Floodlight,One thing employers probably love about you is that you're ready to take charge and take care of whatever needs to be accomplished.  Like Larry the Cable Guy\, your response when a new task presents itself is\, \"Let's get 'er done.\"  This enthusiastic approach to taking on a problem can make you a valued employee and coworker.,One potential problem\, though\, is that your eagerness to get things done sometimes gets the best of you.  You have a tendency to act before you've thought through your strategy or fully determined your long-term goal.  There's plenty to like in a take-charge kind of person at the workplace.  But unless you can find a way to be a bit more cautious at times\, and to think through the different possible outcomes of your actions\,  you're going to severely limit how valuable you can be to those you work with.,,The Floodlight brings leadership\, a direct approach\, and tenacity through enthusiastic spontaneity.,You know how to take charge and dive into action.,You are an enthusiastic asset to any team,Sometimes you should save yourself some time by planning out your approach before jumping into action
LCI,The Candy Store,Dr. Jeckyll\, meet Mr. Hyde.  You seem to have two main parts of yourself.  On one hand\, you can be impulsive\, making quick decisions when faced with a dilemma or problem.  On the other hand\, though\, especially when it comes to work\, you like to collect information and analyze situations before making decisions.,It's good to be able to come at a problem from different perspectives\, but these contradictions may leave you feeling somewhat divided within yourself at times.  Now might be a good time to explore this dichotomy a bit.  What makes you feel so comfortable making a snap decision on a big issue sometimes\, while at other moments you feel the need to fully think something through?  The more you can get clear on your own preferences for how to approach a situation\, the more effective you'll be in your workplace\, and probably in your life as a whole.,,The Candy Store brings versatility and can make effective decisions both impulsively and after long planning process.,You gather information and analyze problems before diving into action.,You are able to make quick and reliable decisions in times of crisis,Sometimes you should weigh whether a problem requires a quick spur-of-the-moment decision or a more thought-out strategy before taking action
LCA,The Free Verse Poet,Spontaneity and creativity guide you in the way you live your life.  Rules?  Not for you.  Structure?  No thanks.  This willingness to free yourself from society's expectations and follow your own imagination can help you create all kinds of new ways to approach problems. You've probably noticed that sometimes you're the first one to come up with a novel idea or solution that's stumped everyone else.,The drawback though\, as you've no doubt already seen\, is that your impulsiveness can sometimes make you seem less responsible or reliable.  Depending on what kind of career you've chosen\, you may have found that your spontaneity can produce negative consequences in terms of how you're perceived by your co-workers.   There's no need to change who you are; your fun-loving\, artistic personality is a strength you should capitalize on.  However\, the more you can also consider the expectations of those around you\, and show yourself to be a reliable\, hard-working colleague\, the more your spontaneity will shine as a strength\, rather than a potential limitation.,,The Free Verse Poet invents revolutionary approaches and solutions through an innate sense of creative spontaneity.,You use creativity and imagination to implement original solutions to complex problems.,You value creative freedom and autonomy in your problem-solving,Sometimes you should reign in your spontaneity in order to integrate into an office environment
LCS,The Web Weaver,OK\, so you're not the most responsible person in the world.  You admit it.  But one of the things you're really good at is connecting with others.  In fact\, that's kind of the point for you:  People matter more than ideas or things or deadlines.  You care about helping people\, and you enjoy the closeness and connection you feel when you're in a group.  You have a spontaneous nature\, and that may be part of why you're good at developing relationships.  Those around you may see you as fun because of your impulsive tendencies.,Your commitment to people is admirable\, and your empathy and sensitivity to others can help you solve problems that come up\, sometimes before other people are even aware of them.  But keep in mind that\, especially in a work situation\, there will be certain expectations that you perform your job reliably.  Most likely\, you'll need to also demonstrate the ability to work with planning and persistence.  So continue to use your social skills and gifts\, but don't let them get in the way of meeting your responsibilities as an employee and co-worker.,,The Web Weaver brings team unity\, sensitivity\, and enthusiasm through spontaneous sociability.,You get along well with others.,You value people and teams over ideas and deadlines,Sometimes you should make difficult decisions and prioritize project deadlines over your team's comfort
LCE,The Trendsetter,Some people love the details.  You?  You’re into the big picture.  You're an idea person. You want to organize and lead others\, taking them further than they would go by themselves.  These visionary tendencies are a real strength for you\, especially when you combine them with hard work and careful planning.,But that's the problem for you\, at least potentially.  You value spontaneity\, perhaps a bit too much.  Instead of gathering information and analyzing a situation when faced with a dilemma\, you're more likely to make a quick\, bold decision.  The willingness to take a risk can bring with it a big pay-off\, but the dangers can be great as well.  So remain aware of your strengths\, as well as where you can use some help.  When you build your team to pursue the next big idea\, make sure you find a team-member who loves the details and can offer a level\, logical\, counter-balance to help give some foundation to your visions and dreams.,,The Trendsetter provides vision\, leadership\, and spontaneity along with a big-picture perspective.,You excel at leadership and spontaneous action.,You can bring your visions to life with hard work and careful planning,Sometimes you should plan your approach before diving into action
LCC,The Impulse Planner,It's not that you have a dual personality\, but you do seem to work from two distinct parts of yourself.  At times\, you're perfectly willing to act spontaneously\, even impulsively.  At moments like these\, you have almost no interest in analyzing a situation or gathering information to help you make a decision.  But when you're given a task at work\, you're usually just the opposite.  There you're methodical\, completing projects by following routines and observing every detail.,This division within yourself is something that would probably be good to explore a bit.  Ask yourself what makes you swing back and forth between impulsivity and conscientiousness.  If you can get more clear on this apparent contradiction\, you'll have a better sense of who you are\, and how you can be more effective and productive\, not only in your job\, but probably in your life as well.,,The Impulse Planner can adopt a spontaneous or methodical style of leadership\, and is ready to lead in any situation.,You are comfortable making spontaneous decisions.,You prefer to dissect and analyze projects before diving into action,Sometimes you should try to become versatile and strike a balance between your separate approaches
HNR,The Power Tool,A new task?  A new challenge?  Bring it on\, you say.  Especially if it requires that you work with your hands and use tools.  One challenge you face fairly regularly\, though\, is learning to control your emotions.  At times\, this may affect your ability to do good work and be appreciated by your boss and coworkers.,You may or may not feel that it's that crucial that the people you work with like you.  After all\, it's not like you want to sit around and discuss a problem\, or have a long\, drawn-out conversation about how best to tackle it.  You like to jump in and go to work right away\, and working independently is just fine with you.  The problem\, though\, is that in most jobs\, you do have to work with others. And get along with them.,That means that now's probably a good time for you to look at your tendency to get upset more easily than others.  The fact that you often react emotionally and intensely when things don't go your way\, means that you're full of passion\, which is a good thing.  The bad news\, though\, is that you're probably not going to be as effective or successful in your job as you might otherwise be unless you demonstrate the ability to maintain control over your feelings and reactions.,The Power Tool brings spirited emotion and drive to practical\, hands-on tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,You prefer concrete projects over abstract assignments,You value jumping into action over sitting around discussing an issue,Sometimes you should work on controlling your emotions in the office to preemptively defuse potential conflicts
HNI,The Passionate Pursuit,There are people in this world who blindly jump into any problem\, ready to immediately take it on.  You?  No way.  Your approach is to carefully and methodically observe a situation\, analyze any relevant information\, then make an informed decision about how best to proceed.  This steady approach has proven successful for you over time\, and the people you work with know they can count on you to fully research a problem and\, often\, come up with an interesting and original approach to it.  ,One issue to remain aware of\, though\, is your tendency to react pretty intensely when things don't go your way.  When new obstacles present themselves before you\, you're not always able to maintain control over your emotions.  This is something you want to pay attention to.  As problems arise at work\, remain aware of how you're experiencing your emotions in your mind and your body\, and take steps to maintain control.  One of the best things you can do is just slow your breathing and relax your shoulders.  Do whatever you need in order to stay in control of yourself.,Then\, once you've calmed yourself\, be proactive in the way you address that particular problem.  Visit with your manager and/or coworkers about whatever upsets you\, and discuss with them how best to address the issue so you can all improve the overall work environment.,The Passionate Pursuit carefully surveys the situation before diving in with intense focus. ,You rely on careful planning and analysis to complete assignments,You excel at inventing original approaches to problems,Sometimes you should take a minute to cool off when your emotions begin to run amuck
HNA,The Kiln,Wow\, you've got it all.  Serious artistic sensibilities\, with the temperament to go with it.  You bring originality and creativity to your work\, and you have little interest in following conventions and expectations.  In your emotional life\, you also tend to move away from the middle.  Especially when things don't go your way\, you can react pretty intensely.  ,Chances are\, there are plenty of people around you who love the gusto with which you work and live your life.  It may be\, too\, though\, that your strong negative reactions when things go wrong are keeping you from being as effective as you could be in terms of doing your job.  Do your best to notice when you feel yourself becoming upset\, and try to manage those feelings before allowing them to explode into larger actions and reactions.,Also\, once you notice something that's consistently upsetting you\, take steps to address the situation.
