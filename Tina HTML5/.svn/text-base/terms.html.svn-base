                    <li>THE COVERED ENTITIES MAKE NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE COVERED ENTITIES DO NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION AS TO THE POTENTIAL REVENUES OR OTHER BENEFITS YOU MAY REALIZE BY USING THE SERVICES.

WE DO NOT REPRESENT THAT THE SITE OR THE SERVICES WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES, OR THAT PROBLEMS WILL BE CORRECTED.

                    <li>THE COVERED ENTITIES ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING ACCESSED VIA ANY LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES, SERVICES, SOFTWARE OR ANYTHING ELSE. YOU BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING THIRD PARTY LINKS, WEBSITES, ETC.</li>

THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF ALL COVERED ENTITIES COLLECTIVELY, FOR ALL ACTIONS ARISING OUT OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, THE PRIVACY POLICY, THE SITE OR THE SERVICES IS $5.00.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITS OF LIABILITY FOR SOME DAMAGES SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</li>
                    <li>From time to time, TidePool may offer new "beta" features or tools with which its users may experiment on the Services.  Such features or tools are offered solely for experimental or test purposes.

            <h6 class="leg-title">Termination</h6>

                    <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our Site, our Services and/or your account at any time for any or no reason (including but not limited to blocking IP addresses). This is not our exclusive remedy under any circumstances. </li>

            <h6 class="leg-title">Other Things Our Lawyers Want Us to Tell You</h6>
                <ol class="leg">
                    <li>These Terms incorporate any policies we post on the site.</li>
                    <li>We reserve the right to change these Terms and our policies at any time. We'll post any change on the site and if you continue to use the Site or our Services, you will have necessarily accepted the new Terms and/or policies.</li>
                    <li>TidePool will be entitled to recover any legal fees and other costs associated with enforcing these Terms.</li>
                    <li>We can communicate with you via email, text, posting on the site and/or our third party social networking accounts.   If you need to give us notice for any reason (other than legal process), you will do so by emailing us at info@tidepool.co.  Emails to other addresses will not satisfy any notice requirement.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for being informed about and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your use of the site and services.</li>
                    <li>These Terms are the entire agreement between you and TidePool and they replace any other agreement between us related to our site, our policies and/or our services. Aside from our right to make changes described in this Agreement, any amendments to these Terms must be in a writing signed by both parties.</li>
                    <li>You cannot assign these Terms without our written agreement. We can assign the Agreement to any entity that agrees to be bound by the terms of these Terms.</li>
                    <li>The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding choice of laws principles. </li>
                    <li>The exclusive venue for any litigation arising from or related to these Terms, our site or our services shall be the courts of Los Angeles County, California, except for any optional arbitration as described next. Excluding claims for equitable relief, if the total amount in dispute is less than $10,000, either party may elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration by initiating arbitration through an established provider that is agreed by the parties.  The arbitration must be conducted under the following rules: (a) at the choice of the party seeking relief, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, or solely on written submissions; (b) no party or witness will make any personal appearance unless the parties agree otherwise; and (c) the winning party may have the arbitrator's award entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any claims (in court or in arbitration) must be brought in the initiating party's individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any class action or other similar proceeding.</li>
                    <li>If any provision of these Terms is unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not be affected. No waiver will be effective unless it is in an explicit writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.</li>
