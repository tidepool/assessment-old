            <p>Kabir is the Founding CEO of TidePool. Following a preschool venture into experimental flight resulting in chipped teeth and a distrust of slides, Kabir sought out slightly gentler learning experiences at the University of Southern California, where he earned a B.A in Neuroscience with minors in Entrepreneurship and International Relations. He has worked at a technology transfer office and a biotech startup. He brings experience, enthusiasm and leadership to the TidePool team.</p>
			<p>Kabir's WorkType is The Maverick. He invests curiosity, energy and vision into all of his endeavors. He finds that he can make accomplishments possible with a team by taking carefully measured risks that preferably don't involve playground slides.</p>

            <p>Galen has a talent for teasing out the patterns and relationships hiding in heaps of raw data. He applied these skills as the Chief Scientist for eHarmony and in his research on Alzheimer's disease and allostatic load. In addition to his work at TidePool, he is currently a Research Scientist at USC's Institute for Creative Technologies, the Director of Research for the Headington Institute, an active Angel investor in the Los Angeles startup community and a committee member for the National Board of Medical Examiners.</p>

			<p>Galen's WorkType is The Free Verse Poet. His creative life revolves around writing and singing for Siggy, his L.A based alternative punk band. He reads Bukowski and Dostoyevsky, listens to Television and Mott the Hoople, and watches Nicolas Roeg and prison reality shows.</p>

            <p>Ryan develops and oversees all written material for users of the TidePool protocol. He is a board certified psychologist in private practice, an adjunct psychology professor, a blogger for Psychology Today and Contributing Editor for Psychotherapy Networker magazine. As a shrink, he collaborates to solve problems, as a professor he disseminates information in a palatable manner and as a writer he brings the complexity of psychology to the masses. At TidePool he's allowed to do all three. Ryan's WorkType is The Clicker, so the collaborative, creative process of thinking up colossal ideas is right up his alley.</p>

Rhett's WorkType, The Power Tool, is a reflection of his hands on approach and can-do attitude. He's a go-getter and jumps into projects rather than sitting back and waiting for things to happen.</p>
